Just been checking out the beta of the [new USA Today site.](http://beta.usatoday.com/)

It’s really slick and they’ve made it as a single page application. They’re using CSS transitions to slide the panels about and it works really well in IE10. It seems to target modern browsers; the transitions don’t fall back to jQuery or anything.
