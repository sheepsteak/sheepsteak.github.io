Now that things are hotting up with Windows 8 I decided I would have another go at blogging. I'm also starting a new job soon and I'm getting into Mac/iOS development so I should have a lot more to talk about.

I thought I would add the Windows 8 video to set the scene. Things seem up in the air at the moment and although I've enjoyed working with Silverlight the recent furore over the new Windows 8 HTML5/JS API has made me realise I need to not put all my eggs in one basket. I'm sure they'll be some sort of Silverlight API for Windows 8 too but branching out a bit more won't do me any harm.
