So it looks like [Facebook are going announce](http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/facebook-android-phone/) their entry into the mobile world this week.

At the moment it looks like they’re either going to announce a fork of Android or, as [John Gruber suggested](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/03/29/facebook-android-mention), maybe some sort of launcher/home screen replacement for existing Android phones. Since it seems HTC are involved and given Facebook’s aspirations I would think it’s the former.

This kind of explains Facebook’s recent push to get [free calls](http://www.androidauthority.com/facebook-messenger-free-calls-now-available-outside-of-us-and-uk-too-180734/) into their existing Facebook Messenger apps. Starting their own mobile platform with this capability baked in from the beginning would make a lot of sense and probably be attractive to a lot of people.

Personally, the thought of _every_ single thing I do on my phone being seen and catalogued by Facebook isn’t very appealing.
