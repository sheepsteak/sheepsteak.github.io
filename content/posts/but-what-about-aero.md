Whilst Metro is the new application model for Windows, Microsoft says that dropping into normal Desktop Mode will still be something that users will still want to do.

After using the Windows 8 Developer Preview for a few months switching to Desktop Mode is a lot less jarring. There’s no doubt that it would be **much** better if it was also given a Metro makeover.
So it was quite a relief to see some evidence of this when I was going through some of the posts over at the [Building Windows 8 blog.](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/10/27/using-task-manager-with-64-logical-processors.aspx) There’s [one screen shot](http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-01-29-43-metablogapi/1031.Select_2D00_the_2D00_logical_2D00_processors_2D00_for_2D00_the_2D00_process_5F00_06557CA7.png) of the new Task Manager UI in particular that shows how the desktop is changing.
I did think they would do something like this since the chrome of the windows was flatter than those in Windows 7. Hopefully we’ll get to see more in the beta that is scheduled for release in February!
