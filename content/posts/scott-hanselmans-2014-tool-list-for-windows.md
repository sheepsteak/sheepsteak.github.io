title: Scott Hanselman’s 2014 Tool List for Windows
---

Scott has [posted](http://www.hanselman.com/tools) his yearly collection of great Windows power user and developer tools.

> These are all well loved and oft-used utilities. I wouldn’t recommend them if I didn’t use them constantly. Things on this list are here because I dig them. No one paid money to be on this list and no money is accepted to be on this list.

Some really good stuff on the list and I find out about something new every year.
