title: New Microsoft Windows 8 App Building Guidance
---

Microsoft’s solution to building composite applications was the [Prism](http://compositewpf.codeplex.com) project. In this new age of Windows 8 it was clear that Prism was far too overcomplicated and didn’t fit the types of UIs that are used in Windows 8; it was designed for a radically different type of application style.

Today Microsoft announced the [Kona](http://konaguidance.codeplex.com/) project. It seems a lot more simple than Prism which is a good thing. My favourite MVVM library is [Caliburn Micro](http://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com) that also included Windows 8 support but I’ll definitely be checking out Kona to see if there are any new tricks for Windows 8.
