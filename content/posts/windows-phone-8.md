So [Windows Phone 8 is announced](http://windowsteamblog.com/windows_phone/b/windowsphone/archive/2012/06/20/announcing-windows-phone-8.aspx) and as rumoured current generation phones are left partially stranded.

There will be a Windows Phone 7.8 for old phones but Iâ€™m glad I decided to sell my Lumia 800 a few weeks before this announcement.

They seemed to skate around announcing WinRT too. Although the fact they talked so much about native code and DirectX makes me think it is there.
