title: Quantity Over Quality

[Well this should ramp up the quality bar on Windows Phone 7.](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ukmsdn/archive/2012/01/20/publish-4-original-amp-unique-windows-phone-apps-amp-get-a-nokia-lumia-800-windows-phone.aspx)

The problem is that there are not enough decent apps. This just encourages people to release four crappy apps to get a phone. Why not give those phones to established iOS developers instead and get them to port over their successful apps?
