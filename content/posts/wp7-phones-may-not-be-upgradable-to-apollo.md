title: WP7 Phones May Not Be Upgradable to Apollo
---

[Big uproar at the moment](http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/17/2956439/windows-phone-8-apollo-no-upgrade) about whether existing WP7 phones will get an upgrade to WP8 (Apollo).

I can understand technically why they might have to do this. WP8 is basically supposed to be a cut down version of Windows 8 whereas WP7 was still based on WindowsCE. However, this would be a massive “FUCK YOU” to the early adopters of WP7 (myself included). They’d effectively be starting from scratch AGAIN. Although WP7 apps have already been confirmed to work on WP8.
