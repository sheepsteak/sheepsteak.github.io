title: A Fresh Start
---

I've spent the last few weeks making this site from the ground up. I was previously pointing my domain at a Tumblr site but as a developer I wanted a place to call my own. It's something I've wanted for some time, probably since I read Rob Conery's [post](http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/be-a-good-jedi-build-your-own-blog) a few years ago. Also, Scott Hanselman's post, [Your Blog is The Engine of Community](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourBlogIsTheEngineOfCommunity.aspx), was a call to action for me.

### The Development Stuff

So I used this as an excuse to get stuck in to some technologies I've had my eye on and played around with a bit. First up was [Node.js](http://nodejs.org). The more I use Node the more I love it. Coming from .NET where a [packaging system](http://www.nuget.org) was a recent addition bolted on top, the integration of [NPM](https://npmjs.org) with Node just _blows_ it away. I intend to do a post soon comparing my experiences.

Something else I wanted to use more was [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org). I'd had chance to use it via .NET at work but using it with [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com) in Node **feels like it was made for it.** I'm using a starter account with [MongoHQ](https://www.mongohq.com/) at the moment so I'll see how that goes.

Finally, I wanted to get some experience of hosting in a cloud environment. I had my eye on [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com) but I wanted to be able to host the site in [Elastic Beanstalk](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) although it seems like they haven't got around to supporting Node yet. Although, they have released an [SDK Developer Preview](http://aws.amazon.com/sdkfornodejs/) so I'll keep an eye on it as although it doesn't support Elastic Beanstalk yet I think this is the way I'll go. I settled on using [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) and I'm _extremely_ pleased with it. Deployment is a breeze and there is very little friction in getting something up.

### The Design Stuff

I've really tried to learn more about design over the last year. I think it's important for _all_ developers to have an interest in design as, like Aral Balkan says, [“Design is not veneer”](http://aralbalkan.com/notes/design-is-not-veneer/). Having my own site is a great way to experiment and develop my skills.

I decided I wanted to make this site [responsive](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/) as I've made a few sites like this at work recently. I'm slowly starting out dealing with typography and layout. I started [mobile first](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933). Hopefully, I can build on this and become more adventurous as my skills improve. There's something so _powerful_ about seeing something you've made on a high resolution mobile screen and it gets addictive fast.

### The Future

What I've built is in no way a blog _engine_. It's a simple wrapper around MongoDB; there's no way for me to add posts through the site even! But I'm looking forward to putting in an admin section and implementing other ideas I have for how I want the site to work. I think I also feel more empowered to post more and use my own creation.

I'm made my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Sheepsteak/Campolina) public if you want to take a look at the code or, heaven forbid, [fork](https://github.com/Sheepsteak/Campolina/fork) and use it yourself!
