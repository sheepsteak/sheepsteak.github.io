title: Microsoft Talks More About Windows 8 on ARM

[More news on what to expect for Windows 8 on ARM.](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/02/09/building-windows-for-the-arm-processor-architecture.aspx)

Steven Sinofsky, Microsoft:

> **WOA includes desktop versions of the new Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote.** These new Office applications, codenamed “Office 15”, have been significantly architected for both touch and minimized power/resource consumption, while also being fully-featured for consumers and providing complete document compatibility. **WOA supports the Windows desktop experience including File Explorer, Internet Explorer 10 for the desktop, and most other intrinsic Windows desktop features**—which have been significantly architected for both touch and minimized power/resource consumption.

It seems very locked down which I think is a good thing. I can see the desktop mode being completely removed for ARM by the time Windows 9 rolls round in another three years. It also seems that they’ve kept it in purely to allow them to deliver Office 15. I guess delivering a new version of Office for WinRT was simply just too much to ask in the time they had.

Although, I would have preferred it if the desktop mode was completely removed for ARM I think this is great news. The Consumer Preview can’t come soon enough!
