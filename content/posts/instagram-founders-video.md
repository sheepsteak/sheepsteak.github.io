Great quote at around 45:30 from Kevin:

> I still don't make as much money as I was offered out of school - the job I didn't take. I've made decisions along the way, that have taken less money along the way, because I love what I'm doing and hopefully that pays back some day.

A few days ago [Facebook bought Instagram for \$1 billion](http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/facebook-to-acquire-instagram-for-1-billion/).
