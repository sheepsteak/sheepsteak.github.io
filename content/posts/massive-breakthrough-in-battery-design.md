title: Massive Breakthrough in Battery Design
---

Great article over on [ExtremeTech](http://www.extremetech.com/computing/153614-new-lithium-ion-battery-design-thats-2000-times-more-powerful-recharges-1000-times-faster) about how the University of Illinois have managed to design a new type of lithium-ion battery design.

Batteries have been a limiting factor of today’s consumer electronics; especially smartphones. If even half of what is mentioned in the article is made available someday then this is brilliant news.

> In real-world use, this tech will probably be used to equip consumer devices with batteries that are much smaller and lighter — imagine a smartphone with a battery the thickness of a credit card, which can be recharged in a few seconds.
