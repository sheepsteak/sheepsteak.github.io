Interesting to hear this about the new version of Android.
I must admit, when I first started using a Windows Phone I loved the back button idea compared to the iOS way. However, I’ve had similar frustrations myself with sometimes wonder where I will end up if I press it. This was compounded for me by the way manufacturers insist on using capacitive touch buttons instead of real buttons. I was constantly catching them and making mistakes. On the LG Optimus 7 with real buttons I rarely make mistakes but the confusion about where I’ll go back to remains. Although, Windows Phone seems to be streets ahead of Android in this area as it made sense where you ended up, it was just difficult to know beforehand.
