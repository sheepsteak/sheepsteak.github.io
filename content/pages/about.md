I've always been interested in computers and was introduced to coding by typing programs from a magazine into my
[Amstrad 64K](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC). Needless to say, they rarely worked as a single typo would
render the whole thing unusable. But I was hooked. The fact that that typing a load of crap in to the computer would
produce something you could play with was amazing to me.

These days my coding techniques are a little less “type and hope”. At least I like to think so, anyway! I started off
in the Microsoft world doing [Windows Forms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Forms). After a couple of years I
made the natural progression to [WPF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation) and
[Silverlight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight).

Another couple of years later I had the opportunity to jump over to web development. Working with HTML/CSS/JS was one
of those things I knew the basics of but didn't really _know_.
